# Changelog

## v1.0.0.2 - 2015-05-05
### Fixed
* Clear saved desktop and window state information on startup, as it is unlikely to be of much use across runs.

### Added
* Added a German translation. Improvements welcome, as it is my second language.

## v1.0.0.1 - unreleased
### Fixed
* Minimized and maximized windows are now restored before applying size/location changes.

the monitor layout changed.
