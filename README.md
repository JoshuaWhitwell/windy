# Windy

Has this ever happened to you?  Your laptop or tablet is docked and has you have external monitors connected, because
who can live with those tiny built-in displays?  You undock your machine, and all your windows get shuffled up and
jammed into that one single tiny screen! Then when you dock it again, all those windows are still a jumbled mess!
Never deal with cluttered windows again, with Windy!

Windy is a lightweight window manager for users of dockable mobile PCs.  It saves window positions and states on
startup and on demand, and watches for desktop layout changes.  When it detects that the desktop layout has changed
back, it restores the original window layout.

## Usage

Run Windy.exe.  Ctrl+Shift+S saves the current window layout (and desktop layout).
Ctrl+Win+R restores the saved window layout.  It's that simple.

For maximum utility, place a shortcut to Windy.exe in your Startup folder.
